# NuGetUtils
[![Version](https://img.shields.io/github/release/thomasgalliker/NuGetUtils.svg)](https://github.com/thomasgalliker/NuGetUtils/releases)

NuGetUtils is a command-line utility to delete/unlist NuGet pre-release packages. In order to minimize the number of alpha and beta releases on NuGet, it's a good practice to clean-up old pre-releases. The aim of NuGetUtils is to remove all pre-release versions of a certain NuGet package. It is recommended to run this utility *after* the successful release of a stable package version.
